# Skill Learning Platform

## Overview

Skill Learning Platform is a microservices-based application built with Spring Boot. The platform allows users to learn skills one-on-one from expert instructors in a progress-driven, personalized manner. The project supports flexible learning with a schedule-focused, passion-based approach, offering real-time progress tracking, feedback, and secure payments.

## Features

- **User Management**: Supports registration, authentication, and role management for students and instructors.
- **Skill and Course Management**: Handles skills, courses, and lesson content with detailed tracking of instructor expertise.
- **Scheduling and Progress Tracking**: Manages individual schedules for students and instructors, tracking lesson completion and course progress.
- **Feedback and Ratings**: Allows students to rate and provide feedback on instructors and courses.
- **Payments**: Securely processes payments for courses, with support for refunds and promotional codes.
- **Notifications**: Sends email/SMS notifications for reminders, payments, and feedback updates.
- **API Gateway and Service Discovery**: Routes requests and enables inter-service communication with ease.

## Microservices Overview

1. **User Service**: User authentication and management.
2. **Skill Service**: Manages skills available on the platform.
3. **Course Service**: Course creation and updates.
4. **Lesson Service**: Manages lesson content within courses.
5. **Schedule Service**: Scheduling of classes and sessions.
6. **Progress Service**: Tracks student progress in courses.
7. **Feedback Service**: Handles ratings and feedback.
8. **Payment Service**: Manages transactions and payment history.
9. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for sessions, payments, and reminders.
10. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to the respective services.
11. **Discovery Service**: Manages service registry and discovery.
12. **Config Service**: Provides centralized configuration management.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud** (Eureka, Gateway, Config)
- **Spring Security** with JWT Authentication
- **Hibernate/JPA** for data persistence
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for relational data storage
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL storage (optional)
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** for message brokering
- **Docker** for containerization
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for monitoring (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Docker** for containerizing microservices
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for relational databases
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** for messaging (if using asynchronous communication)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skill-learning-platform.git
   cd skill-learning-platform
   ```

2. **Set Up Databases**:

    - Create databases for each service as outlined in the `.env` file or application properties.
    - Set up RabbitMQ/Kafka and the message broker of choice.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   Create an `.env` file in the root directory, or configure your environment with the necessary variables. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for required values.

### Running the Application

1. **Run Config and Discovery Services**:

   Start `config-service` and `discovery-service` to initialize configuration and service discovery.

   ```bash
   cd config-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   cd ../discovery-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Run Microservices**:

   Navigate to each service directory and start them one by one, or use Docker Compose to spin up all services.

   ```bash
   cd user-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Run API Gateway**:

   ```bash
   cd api-gateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   The services are now available at their designated endpoints. Use the API Gateway for client access:

   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:8080  # Default API Gateway port
   ```
